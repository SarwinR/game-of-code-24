## Challenge
In the Game of Code challenge, participants had just 12 hours to create an immersive web or mobile application that encourages learning through coding-related puzzles. The goal was to simplify coding concepts into a gaming format, making it fun and engaging for users.

## Our Solution
To create an immersive web application that simplifies coding concepts through puzzles, we developed a website using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Our solution includes the following components:

### Website Development
- HTML: Structured the webpage with a code editor, console, and game interface.
- JavaScript: Implemented game logic, user interactions, and the AI assistant.
- CSS: Styled the interface for an engaging user experience.
### Key Features
- Basic Code Editor: Allows players to write and test code with syntax highlighting.
- Console: Displays real-time feedback, including error messages and execution results.
- Tile-Based Game: Players solve coding puzzles to navigate a character through a grid of tiles.
- F12 Menu Encouragement: Encourages players to explore browser developer tools for deeper learning.
- AI Assistant: An evil yet helpful AI provides hints, adding an intriguing challenge.

Our solution effectively combines education and entertainment, making coding fun and accessible.
